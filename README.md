# Virtually-Controlled-Mini-car
This Project is a prototype for Driver Less car based on the idea of natural human Interface using kinect in which a person gets Virtual driving experience. For GUI Interface I made use of WPF .net Framework and by leveraging Bluetooth 32feet .net libraries helped successfully in establishing communication between PC and Mini-Car powered by Arduino Mini(with Integrated H-Bridge Motor)
Just the Human skeleton is percepted in 2D picture and with that skeleton class objects you can play with the code.
I used bluetooth module HC-05 for Communication between pc and arduino for transcribing commands received by the kinect
